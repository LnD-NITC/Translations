<h5>1. Introduction of a Soldier:</h5>
    <p>According to the popular narrative, when the power was being transferred, the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wanted some Britisher to be the General of Indian Army. According to him, we didn’t have a capable army General. Majority agreed to this except Nathuram Rathod who opposed this decision and said that the governance of the country should also be given to a Britisher and only after deliberate discussions K.M. Kariappa was made the first Lieutenant General of independent India.


    </p>

        <p>
    The missions that Indian soldiers did for the Monarchy of Britain and the ones they did for the Indian democracy are totally different.Then, neither could they look into their eyes nor could we raise our voices. They were treated like the dust under the Britishers’ shoes and they were given their leftovers. Today’s India has now broken the shackles of slavery and is capable of guiding the world, brimming with pride.  A soldier's duty is to keep their nation safe and to establish peace and stability in the world. They are capable of facing Siachen’s blood freezing cold to Thar’s tear boiling heat. Their eyes strike terror into the hearts of enemies and give hope to their comrades. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Devotion to the motherland is the Supreme Duty.</b></p>





   
<h5>2. History of the Indian Army:</h5>
  <p>
    Kodandera Madapya Cariappa was made the first Army Chief (Commander-in-Chief General) of the Indian Army. In the year 1949, the Indian Army freed itself from the clutches of British rule and joined the Indian Republic. India at that time was very different from today's India. Not much time had passed since the conflict of 1947, on top of that, there was the partition of India which resulted in a river of blood on the streets, millions of people were becoming homeless, amidst all this, India needed a strong army which could guard its borders.

      </p>
      <p>While India gained independence in 1947, the saga of our modern army dates back much earlier. During the First World War, the British government had promised Indians the status of dominion. On this occasion, the nobility and bureaucrats joined hands with British rule, sending unaware soldiers into the slaughterhouse of war. Many soldiers bid farewell to this world in the ancient and luxurious cities of Europe as well as the sandy seas of Egypt during the First World War.
</p>


      <p>
       Their hopes were for a better future for their people, but the promises of the British turned out to be as hollow as a bamboo tree.

Similarly, they fought against the evils of Nazism and Fascism during the Second World War. In the epic struggle, an Indian soldier had to leave his newlywed wife for a mission in Italy, only to return and find that she had been married off to someone else.

The history books seldom mention such Indian soldiers who fought against Fascism and Nazism. In return for such sacrifices, Winston Churchill looted our grain fields like marauders, leading to the death of approximately 3.8 million people in the Bengal Famine of 1943. Bengal ,  considered the center of Indian art , its people were taken over by malnutrition.

<h5>3. Accomplishments Of The Indian Army</h5>

      <p>
    Just as a parasite sucks the life out of its host plant, wars drain the society of all humanity and meaning. But every time a war has been declared, India has always propagated peace and nobility, abiding by the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, when West Pakistan declared war against East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971, they crossed all limits of barbarism as over the span of 9 months, more than 3 million people were killed and those who survived never had light snatched from their lives. During all this, Pakistani forces made many women widows and took away their self respect. The Bengalis had to escape to India to survive this conflict. India trained Mukti Bahi to liberate Eastern Bengal where Bangladeshis came from far and wide and trained under the Indian army to liberate their country. This twelve day war finally came to an end on 16th December. General Abdullah Khan Niazi unconditionally surrendered along with 94000 Pakistani soldiers to General Ajit Singh Arora. 

      </p>

        <p>Indian forces have always tried to establish peace. U.N. 's Indian Peacekeepers have taken part in almost 49 peacekeeping missions. We have provided almost 253000 soldiers which is more than the contribution of any other country. As an example, when Israel and Lebanon war stopped, the Indian soldiers had an important role in establishing the Demilitarised Border Area. 

</p>

 <h5>4. Tribulations Of The Indian Army</h5>
      <p>
      The price of the immense valor of our soldiers is often their lives, their plight aggravated by the army regimen. According to a 2017 report by The Wire, 1600 soldiers lost their lives to suicide, accidents and diseases, an issue that is actively suppressed by politicians for the fear of losing their position of power to controversy. Even today, the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report, which could throw light on countless veiled details of the 1962 Indo-China war, has been kept in the dark. Investigators speculate that the reason the report has been kept from the public is because the flaws mentioned in the 60-year-old report are still plaguing our army.


      </p>
      <p>
      In 2022, the Agnipath Scheme was introduced which worsened the situation further. Officials who'd never set foot in the battlefield took an exceptionally thoughtless decision to introduce this scheme without any real deliberation and consideration. What followed was a series of vehement protests, some of which turned violent, but all in vain. It is indescribable how the dreams of all army aspirants will be shattered, knowing their tenure of service will end in 4 years with no pension. Is this their reward for putting their lives at stake for our country?
     </p>

<h5>5. People's perception </h5>

      <p>
     A soldier's struggles are not only physical but also mental. Indian cinema has created a popular perception that a soldier's biggest struggles are bodily. This imagination causes many people to overlook their mental problems. Imagine if you wake up tomorrow and you don't see your loved ones, even such a small thought sends shivers down the spine, but this is the condition of a soldier's family. First of all meeting only once every six months and even then you can't say what might happen. Have you ever thought about how their families live? People still don't know about disorders like P.T.S.D. Losing your friend in such an early life, spending your time in the smell of flesh and gunpowder and  escaping death, all these accidents leave serious trauma which the soldiers have to deal with. Maybe the coming generations will understand this unseen aspect of a soldier's life.
