    <p> Awaiting the return of his loved one, the speaker reflects on the fear of losing cherished memories and questions the chase for societal achievements, wondering what truly matters if the world were to end today.

    </p>

    <p>The speaker asks his loved one if she would be afraid if she knew that today was the end of the world. Would she remember the joyful moments they shared together? Would she appreciate the beauty of nature, like the moon and morning dews she has overlooked in her life?
    </p>

    <p>He questions if she would forget about all the material possessions she has accumulated and simply enjoy the beauty of their home. He regrets that she never took the time to visit her grandma, listen to her stories, or rest on her lap.
    </p>

<p>Feeling these reflections may be in vain, the speaker longs for a simpler life and yearns to return home. Believing that everything around him, including nature, is also waiting for her to notice, he vows to wait for his loved one’s return.</p>
