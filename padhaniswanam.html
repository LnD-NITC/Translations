    </p>

    <p>He asks his loved one if she would be afraid, knowing today was the end of the world. Would she remember the joyful moments they shared? Would she appreciate the beauty of nature, like the moon and morning dews she has overlooked in her monotonous life? He regrets that she never took the time to visit her grandma, listen to her stories, or rest on her lap.
